# Who's That Petr!

<h2> This project was done with a team of 4 at Zothacks where we built a fun memory game! </h2>
<h3> In about 20 seconds, pictures of blurred Petr stickers would appear to the user and they would have 4 choices to choose the correct name. </h3>
<h3> The user had a total point score at the end. </h3>
