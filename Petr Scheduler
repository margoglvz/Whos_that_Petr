Welcome to the Petr Scheduler!

We ran out of time to integrate the Petr Scheduler into our main web application, but here is the sourve ode and functionality!

Purpose:
The Petr Scheduler is designed to take images uploaded by the user and extract the date and time of the Petr Drop!
With the information, the Petr Scheduler enters it into the system which originally was a calendar but now is stored 
on a local file of this git repository!

Function:
Petr scheduler utilizes parsing open source code alongside text extraction libraries which are also open sourced.
The Scheduler then takes the parsed information and presents it in a way that is human friendly and readable.

Please try out the demo and test the limits of the algorithms used to extract and recognize dates and times!
